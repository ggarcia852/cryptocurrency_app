# cryptocurrency_app

Crypto~VRSE came to life as a passion project after a new interest in cryptocurrency to test my skills with Python and Flask using the Coin Market Cap API. 
Aside from configuring the API and the different endpoints, I really enjoyed the UI/UX aspect of the project as I tried to encompass a theme for the uses of the app. Most of the styling was done using Bootstrap.

The idea behind Crypto~VRSE is a space where all things crypto come together for your convenience. 
You can create a wallet to keep track of all your different assets in place and view up-to-date cryptocurrency listings and trending coins.
Features to come are personalized charts for your assets and a way to stay connected with other users!

Anyone is able to search for current cryptocurrency listings but in order to build a wallet you will need to create an account.
